Daily Flow

- [ ] Pull latest: click Fetch origin, then Pull origin in GitHub Desktop.
- [ ] Create a branch: Current Branch → New Branch → name it `feature/<short-title>` → Publish branch.
- [ ] Work in Godot: make small, focused changes; prefer separate scenes to reduce conflicts.
- [ ] Save in Godot, then write a one‑line, action‑oriented commit message in Desktop and Commit to your branch.
- [ ] Publish (push) your branch if Desktop hasn’t published it yet.
- [ ] Create a Pull Request from Desktop: Preview Pull Request → Create Pull Request; add a brief summary and any notes.
- [ ] Get 1 approval; address comments and mark conversations as resolved.
- [ ] Merge with Squash and merge on GitHub; delete the branch when offered.
- [ ] Back in Desktop: Fetch/Pull origin; switch to `main` for the next task.

Tips
- Use GitHub Desktop for all adds/commits so binary assets use LFS.
- If a merge conflict appears, sync with your teammate; keep one version and re‑apply the other’s edits in Godot if needed.
