Quick Start

- [ ] Install GitHub Desktop and Godot 4.5.1.
- [ ] One‑time setup: open Command Prompt and run `git lfs install`.
- [ ] Clone the repo in GitHub Desktop: File → Clone repository → URL → `https://github.com/jiteshvm/GameJam2025.git` → Clone.
- [ ] Set Godot as the default editor in GitHub Desktop (Options → Integrations) to `C:\GodotEngine\Godot_v4.5.1-stable_win64.exe`.
- [ ] Open the project: Repository → Open in default editor (launches Godot).
- [ ] Run the game in Godot (press Play) to verify everything works.

Do / Don’t
- Do commit via GitHub Desktop so large assets go through LFS automatically.
- Do place art/audio/video/models in `assets/`.
- Don’t upload files through the GitHub website (bypasses LFS filters).
- Don’t edit the same scene as someone else without coordinating.
